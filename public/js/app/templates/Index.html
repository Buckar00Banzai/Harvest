					<P>AFRIKA TEMBO is a documentary project by visual anthropologist Carolina Caff√© and documentary photographer Fernanda Lenz. The team will spend a month in Tanzania producing both a web series and a visual journal about the rapid decline of the African elephant population, and their risk of extinction within the next few decades.<br/>
					<br/>
					Does Africa have to choose between modernization and wildlife? The project will document how organizations and communities are joining efforts to promote development hand in hand with conservation.<br/>
					<br/>
					Through the power of filmmaking, we seek to awaken a sense of responsibility for our planet and inspire people to take action on local and global issues that are ultimately connected and affect each one of us.<br/>
					<br/>
					The clock is ticking, and AFRIKA TEMBO has a couple of days to raise the funding that is still missing. We ask for your help and we thank you with special gifts!<br/>
					<br/>
					Join the efforts to protect African elephants and be part of the team showing that every voice counts.</P>
