					<P>Is Africa able to modernize and pursue economic growth while preserving its natural resources and cultural diversity?<br/>
					<br/>
					AFRIKA TEMBO is a documentary project by visual anthropologist Carolina Caff√© and documentary photographer Fernanda Lenz. During one month in Tanzania the team will produce a web series and a visual journal about elephant poaching and how organizations and communities in Tanzania work together to strengthen alternative models of development that are sustainable, inclusive, respect cultural diversity and the environment.<br/>
					<br/>
					With the ongoing poaching and trafficking crisis, the web series examines the plight of the African elephant from different perspectives, as told through stories set in Tanzania, a key elephant range state where poaching and trafficking are currently quite high. Episodes cover both immediate and longer-term efforts to ensure a future for elephants and the people who live alongside them.<br/>
					<br/>
					Through the power of filmmaking, we seek to awaken a sense of responsibility for our planet and inspire people to take action for local and global issues that ultimately are connected and affect each one of us.<br/>
					<br/>
					The documentary production has been possible with a initial support and is still in need of funding. The clock is ticking and AFRIKA TEMBO has only 25 days left to raise the $15,000 needed  to cover travel insurance, malaria pills, equipment, crew and logistic costs.<br/>
